Q: What can you tell us about your currency?

We’ve all had questions regarding life, the universe, and everything about it, whether we asked them to each other or simply to ourselves. However, one famous entity has already answered this through an iconic book. The answer, is 42-coin, a PoS+PoW coin with public and anonymous transactions. As such, a coin was made around this iconic number. With a maximum supply of 42 coins, it would not only embody the number, but also make each coin extremely rare.

Q: What type of services exist or can we expect in the future?”

The work that was done for the old coin was not lost, however, with it still being listed on Bitcoin Checker, an Android app that checks the most recent prices of various altcoins and BTC itself, as well as Bitcoin Buzz Feeds, an app that notifies users of news and other events around various altcoins. New work has also been completed, with a wallet for Windows and Linux with support for anonymous transactions, a new key feature, completed in November 2016. A wallet for Mac was released in January 2017 and an Android wallet will be released soon, thus making 42-coin one of the few coins with a core-developed mobile wallet. So, even people with smartphones will be able to participate in the transaction confirmation. Other planned improvements are also underway, such as making a new website for the coin and pushing for it to be added into more exchanges (currently you can trade 42-coin only on Cryptopia Exchange), all planned for 2017.

Q: Are you targeting the consumer or Business Market? If so, how does the business model work?”

Since it is an open source decentralized cryptocurrency, it can be used everywhere by everyone…
There is an idea to integrate 42 into different businesses that use the number 42 in their names, if you are interested, you can easy ‘google’ some of them.

Q: What are the details around the most important project you’re working on currently?

All the projects that somehow connected with 42-coin are very important for me because 42 is my first experience. I was a trader who does not sell at a loss but stuck with non liquid coin… And then “you become responsible forever, for what you have tamed” (Antoine de Saint-Exupery).
I am currently working on an adaptation of JavaScript Wallet Generator for 42-coin and on Android wallet, everything is open source, so you can see all the details on the GitHub.

Q: How does the competition compare?

42 is young, a community is slowly, but surely, growing around it. Our competitors are not stronger in technology but mostly on marketing and PR.
With no premine and no ICO, the relaunch of 42-coin makes it one of the few new communities that stays true to the principles brought on by Bitcoin. It’s not too late for you to join the 42. Come join us on bitcointalk, IRC, Twitter, or Tox and joining us in spreading the answer of life, the universe, and everything! ))

Q: The market has many players, what differentiates you?”

The first difference is that 42 – is a coin with a deflationary emission model and a very limited supply. The block reward is zero and only the PoW miners can gather the fees from transactions. So, new coins are not produced and nobody can make a constant pressure on the price – this makes 42-coin safe for investors.
The second unique feature is a “42-coin Community Fund” – the holders are able to make any proposal how to spend the available funds for development (unclaimed coins left after the swap) via anonymous but transparent voting system based on blockchain.
The third unique feature is the “Nodes Ranking System” (serves to maintain the network on initial stage) – the limited numbers of users who run the full node receives the small reward depending on the total time that their node has been online.

Q: could you tell us more about your achievements in this?”

Back to the limited supply was not my idea, it was the original idea of this coin and the community voted in favor for it. For my part, I just helped to implement it. Actually, everything that was done, it was agreed with the community and supported by them.

Q: could you tell us more about where you see Blockchain technology in the future?”

I believe that Blockchain technology would be widespread implemented in all trustworthy services where it is applicable, especially in finance sector, voting and notary systems, metadata protection, etc.
